# Groupomania

Groupomania is a professional social network enabling companies to create links and interaction between employees.
The web application contains all the functionalities of a classic social network (publications, like button, comments).
We had to build the application from scratch.
The API is based on NodeJS & Express.
A JS framework was needed for the client side, and Angular was chosen for its MVC structure and performance.
